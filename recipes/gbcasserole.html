    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            It is the dish everyone is expecting on the holidays, but it is so easy to make, you can serve it any day.
             Created by Campbell Test Kitchen Manager Dorcas Reilly in 1955, its creamy, smooth sauce and unmatchable 
             flavor combined with its simplicity makes Green Bean Casserole so appealing. Just five ingredients and 10
              minutes to put together, this family pleasing side has been a favorite for over 60 years.
