    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pork chops are very easy to make and taste so delicious. This recipe is even more special because it pairs the pork chops with a cinnamon apple sauce that complements
            the saltiness of the pork and adds a sweet flavor of cinammon apple. This is a family favorite and can be served for dinner or can be meal prepped for the week.

            take your first bite. Enjoy!!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Golden Delicious apples, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 ounces golden raisins, a handful</li>
            <li>1-inch piece fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all natural apple juice or cider, plus a splash for pan sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or olive oil, 2 turns of the pan</li>
            <li>4 (1-inch) thick center cut boneless pork loin chops, 6 to 8 ounces each</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine first 8 ingredients in a medium pot placed over medium high heat and cook until a 
                chunky sauce forms, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. If sauce begins to spatter as 
                it bubbles, reduce heat back a little, but it should be allowed to reduce and form quickly.
                 Once apples are soft and sauce forms, remove it from the heat.

                Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add oil to the pan. Season chops on 1 
                side with salt and pepper. Using a pair of tongs, add chops to hot skillet seasoned side down.
                 Season the opposite side of the chops with salt and pepper. Brown and caramelize the chops 2 
                 minutes on each side, then reduce heat to medium and cook another 5 to 6 minutes, turning occasionally,
                  until juices run clear. Remove chops from heat and let them rest a couple of minutes for juice to
                 redistribute. Deglaze the pan with a splash of apple juice and 2 tablespoons of butter. Pour pan sauce 
                   over chops. Remove ginger from the sauce and top chops with generous portions of warm golden apple sauce.
