# odin-recipes
A website that contains a few of my favorite recipes.

This is my first project in TOP and it will be my first ever Web Development project
as well. This project will allow me to use my skills learned so far. This website will contain an index page with links to a few of my favorite recipes. Each link will take you to another html page that includes a picture of the dish as well as the ingredient list (unordered) and a list of steps (ordered) to make the dish. I will use a combination of different tags and elements as well as lists to create this project.
